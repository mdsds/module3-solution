      <p>  The house Targaryen is a noble family, descendants of old Valyria, who, for almost three hundred years, ruled the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.  The Targaryen symbol is a three-headed red dragon spitting fire on a black background. Its motto is "Fire and Blood". They were one of the families known as Dragon Lords who ruled the Valyrian Empire. A few years before the Valyrian Doom, the Targaryens left their home in Essos and settled in Dragonstone, an ancient Valyrian fortress on the Westeros coast. There they resided for more than a century, until Aegon, the Conqueror and his sister-wives, Visenya and Rhaenys, started the War of Conquest. 
        In less than three years of war, Aegon I Targaryen managed to unify six of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros (with the exception of Dorne, which would only be annexed later, via diplomacy). On their old camp, on the coast of the Agua Negra Bay, the Targaryens built a new city, Porto Real, and from there, inside the Red Fortress, sitting on the Iron Throne (built from the enemies' melted swords), they would rule unified Westeros. The Dragonstone castle would become the seat of the crown prince. The Targaryens eventually built.</p>

      <h2>Beef</h2>

      <p> The Targaryens ruled with the titles of King of the Ándalos, of the Roinares and of the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, besides being lords of the Land of the Crown, for almost 300 years. Seventeen Targaryen kings sat on the Iron Throne. Eventually, over time, internal conflicts, challenges from other houses and the death of their dragons would weaken their power. The last of the dynasty was Aerys, the Mad King, who was dethroned during the War of the Usurper, ending the Targaryen reign over Westeros, being replaced in power by the House Baratheon. At the beginning of The Chronicles of Ice and Fire, the last living descendants of House Targaryen were Aerys II's two youngest children, Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen (a character from the point of view), who are in exile in the Free Cities on the continent. of Essos.

      <h2>Sushi</h2>

      <p> Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi, stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui "to be sour";the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.</p>
